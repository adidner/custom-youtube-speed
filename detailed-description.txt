This extension lets you change the speed of YouTube videos in a more granular way than the default options in the player. The player on YouTube let's you change the speed to 0.25x, 0.5x, 0.75x, 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75x, and 2.0x the normal speed. This extension lets you change the speed of playback to between 0.1x to 8.0x normal speed by steps of 1.0, 0.5, 0.1, or 0.05. 

Once you find a speed you like, you can also save it as the default speed which all YouTube videos will play at when opening.

By default this extension adds a the ability to control the speed of a YouTube video and some playback with keyboard shortcuts. The '+' and '-' keys to change the speed by 0.1 and to the '*' and '/' keys change the speed in increments of 1.0. If you hold shift while pressing these, '+' and '-' move in steps of 0.05 and '*' and '/' move in steps of 0.5. It also assigns '`' to reset the speed to 1.0x normal speed. Finally, it uses '[' and ']' to move through the video in time steps proportional to the speed of the video, rather than in increments of 5 or 10 seconds. These shortcuts can be disabled if you prefer not to have them on a per page basis.

I cannot promise every single YouTube page and video will work perfectly with this extension. This is an extension I made for me because I wanted it. I believe it works as described everywhere, but YouTube has a lot of places like gaming, educational playlists, livestreams, etc. This extension is open source on GitHub (see website) link, and I am open to suggestions, issues, and fixes but I cannot make any promises about what I will do with those things if i receive them.
